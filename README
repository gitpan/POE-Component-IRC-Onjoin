This module implements a class that provides moved message and onjoin
services as an IRC bot. Based on the configuration parameters passed
to it via it's constructor it will connect to a channel on a server
and immediately send everyone on that channel a message privately.
It will also send the same message to the channel itself publically
at the specified interval. All users joining the channel thereafter
will also recieve the message. 

An useful example of this would be when a channel moves either to a
new channel or network, you would be able to inform anyone
connecting to the old channel about the move.

This module requires POE v0.12 and POE::Component::IRC v1.0b.
