NAME
    POE::Component::IRC::Onjoin - provides IRC moved message & onjoin
    services

SYNOPSIS
     use POE::Component::IRC::Onjoin;

     my $onjoin  = POE::Component::IRC::Onjoin->new
     (
       -nick     => 'OnJoinBot',
       -channel  => '#onjoinbot',
       -servers  => [qw(token.rhizomatic.net binky.rhizomatic.net)],
       -message  => q(Hello! Just as an fyi, we moved to #blah),
     );

     $onjoin->engage();

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements a class that provides moved message and onjoin
    services as an IRC bot. Based on the configuration parameters passed to
    it via its constructor it will connect to a channel on a server and
    immediately send everyone on that channel a message privately. It will
    also send the same message to the channel itself publically at the
    specified interval. All users joining the channel thereafter will also
    recieve the message.

    An useful example of this would be when a channel moves either to a new
    channel or network, you would be able to effectively inform anyone
    connecting to the old channel about the new one.

    Class methods:

      new (constructor)

      Takes the following arguments:
