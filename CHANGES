       - Fixed a bug that resulted in being "excess flooded" off
         a server due to mass onjoins after a split.

       - Fixed a bug that caused self-noticing as the bot joined.
       - Fixed a bug that was causing a single extraneous notice.
       - Fixed a typo (missing semi-colon) on the POD usage example.
       - Fixed a bug that prevented the disabling of public messaging
         when the interval was set to zero.
       - Added customizable exit message, username, ircname, and delay.
       - If a server error or disconnect occurs we will continue
         randomly trying the servers (that were specified) for
         a connection.
       - We now implement a POE style timer for better performance
